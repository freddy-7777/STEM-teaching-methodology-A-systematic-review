91,Career Interest Survey (STEM-CIS),Quantitative,This survey measures secondary school students’ aspirations towards STEM subjects and careers. The results indicate that the interest in STEM subjects in general is not at a high level in any of the countries (Finland and Russia).
43,CT (Computational Thinking) assessment,Quantitative,"This tool light on the correlation between algorithmic thinking skills and age in early childhood, revealing that age is a predictor factor for algorithmic thinking and, therefore, for CT."
65,Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA),Quantitative,"This multivariate analysis was used to determine possible differences between male and female math anxiety and math self-efficacy levels. Male engineering students reported higher self-efficacy and lower math anxiety levels, and this difference was shown to be significant according to the MANOVA results."
37,Survey,Quantitative,"This parametric and non-parametric test analysis carry out to analyze secondary school students’ career interests in STEM subjects. Results indicated that, on average, participant students showed positive interest in STEM careers."
53,Analysis of reflective interviews,Qualitative,"This analysis considers the tensions emerge from conflicts in the cultural-discursive arrangements around education in the advanced democratic states through an exploration of the response to a STEM curriculum project in a Catholic education system. As result is concluded that while the teachers are aware of the tensions, they may benefit from access to a language for discussing the various pressures on learning design and meaning making."
79,RISC (Research on the Integrated Science Curriculum) surveys,Qualitative,This survey examined female and male college students’ views of science education within their chosen major (STEM versus non-STEM). As result only a few gender differences were recorded in students’ views of science education within their STEM and non-STEM majors.
76,Questionnaires based on TRi-STEM scale,Quantitative,"TRi-STEM scale, validated to measure teachers’ readiness in implementing STEM education. TRi-STEM comprises four dimensions: affective conditions (AC), cognitive conditions (CC), self-efficacy (SE), and STEM commitment (SC)."
68,"Analysis based on interests, prestige, and sex type",Qualitative,"This study investigates career profiles of German university freshmen based on interests, prestige, and sex type. Of note, especially female students in STEM subjects with a low proportion of females distributed widely across the 11 profiles identified."
84,Online questionnaire,Qualitative,"The purpose of this study based on identify online teaching strategies appropriate for blended and face-to-face higher STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. The recommendations derived contribute to improving the learning outcomes of online STEM education in many similar institutions."
71,Mixed-method approach (cross-sectional study and a bibliometric analysis),Qualitative,"This study analyzes the factors caused anxiety or depression in teachers during pandemic COVID-19 combining a cross-sectional study of university teachers from Ecuador and Spain with a medium of twenty years of working experience and a bibliometric analysis carried out in three databases. The combination of the results indicated that mental health in STEM teachers at university is related to diverse factors, from training to the family and working balance."
69,Survey questionnaire,Qualitative,This study explored in-service teachers’ views on the use of a digital educational escape room in virtual reality. The results revealed that such alternative instructional solutions can potentially enhance the cognitive benefits and learning outcomes.
,instrument,,
63,Analysis over the explanations and tasks set out in different science textbooks,Qualitative,"Findings showed inconsistencies were detected in the distribution of volume measurement-related content, as well as in the strategies, units tools used in the two areas."
88,surveys about the student’s perceptions of the mathematical modeling approach,Qualitative,"According to the results of the quantitative analysis, after the completion of the STEM project students perceived that mathematical modeling is a useful tool for recognizing problem situations in the present, for predicting future societal changes, and identifying possible solutions to balance the needs of present and future generations."
31,"Mixed-methods research that consisted of a document analysis, a survey, and a systematic review",Qualitative,"The purpose of this study based how to teach STEM concepts in a Bahasa Indonesia subject as integrated learning. The results showed as the main goal and science concepts as an approach to address goals, and recommends it be taught using reading."
70,Mixed research design consists of an adapted Mahoney Student Attitude toward STEM instrument and individual interviews,Qualitative,"This study examined the impact of the UDL-MI- (Universal Design for Learning model- Multiple Intelligence theory) oriented STEM program on eighth-grade rural students’ attitudes towards STEM. The results indicated that in comparison to the traditional classroom, the UDL-MI-oriented program significantly improved and maintained the"
,,,students’ attitudes towards STEM.
17,Challenge-based learning,Qualitative,"Students were exposed to the conceptual, procedural, and attitudinal contents applied to solve the challenge assigned by the industrial partner. Students with an industrial partner showed a higher engagement, and they were more motivated in learning the subject, compared to students having classes in the traditional way."
83,Administrative records from,Quantitative,"This study examines gender differences in medical students’ specialty choices. Results showed that ultra physical load, discrimination in recruitment, women-unfriendly work climates, and difficulties in taking care of family are barriers that prevent women from choosing surgery."
,a top medical school in China,,
74,Machine learning algorithms,AI Quantitative,"This study aimed to evaluate and predict factors affecting STEM students’ future intention to enroll in chemistry-related courses. Results showed that attitude toward chemistry and perceived behavioral control represent the most influential factors, followed by autonomy and affective behavior."
66,Survey items,Qualitative and Quantitative,This study research the perceptions of the effects of taking online courses during the COVID-19 pandemic on their sense of belonging in their major. Findings stressed the poor sense of belonging that engineering students may have after taking online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic when they missed opportunities to develop meaningful relationships with their peers and professors due to the lack of good communication.
